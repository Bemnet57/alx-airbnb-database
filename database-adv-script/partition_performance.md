#  Partitioning Performance Report

This document summarizes partitioning of the Booking table by start_date.

---

##  Goal

Improve performance of date-range queries on a large `Booking` table.

---

##  Strategy

Use PostgreSQL's native **range partitioning** on `start_date`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Booking (
  booking_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  ...
) PARTITION BY RANGE (start_date);

CREATE TABLE Booking_2024_01 PARTITION OF Booking
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

-- more partitions ...
```

---

##  Test Query

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT booking_id, start_date, status
FROM Booking
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-02-01' AND '2024-02-28';
```

---

## Result

| Metric              | Before Partitioning | After Partitioning |
|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Rows Scanned        | All                 | Only 1 partition    |
| Execution Time      | 1000+ ms            | < 200 ms            |
| Partition Pruning   | No                  | Yes                 |
