# Optimization Report

This document summarizes how we optimized a complex query by reducing joins, selecting only necessary columns, and adding indexes.

---

##  Initial Query

Joined `Booking`, `User`, `Property`, and `Payment` and selected many fields. Performance was poor on large datasets.

---

##  Refactored Query

```sql
SELECT 
    b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.end_date, b.status,
    u.first_name, u.last_name,
    p.name AS property_name,
    pay.amount
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
LEFT JOIN Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
WHERE b.start_date >= '2024-01-01' AND b.status = 'confirmed';
```

- Reduces unnecessary columns
- Includes WHERE + AND for filtering
- Uses indexed columns
