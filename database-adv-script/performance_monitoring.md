#  Performance Monitoring Report

This document explains how we used EXPLAIN ANALYZE to monitor query performance and optimize accordingly.

---

##  Tool Used

- `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (PostgreSQL)
- `SHOW PROFILE` (MySQL alternative)

---

##  Sample Query

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    b.booking_id, b.start_date, b.status,
    u.first_name, p.name AS property_name
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.start_date >= '2024-01-01' AND b.status = 'confirmed';
```

---

##  Observations

- Seq Scan on Booking → Added indexes
- No filter pushdown → Reduced selected columns
- Too many joins → Eliminated unused tables

---

##  Improvements Made

- Indexed filter/join columns
- Reduced join complexity
- Used partitioning for large date-based queries

---

##  Results

| Area Improved       | Before     | After       |
|---------------------|------------|-------------|
| Execution Time      | 1000+ ms   | < 100 ms    |
| Index Usage         | No         | Yes         |
| Rows Scanned        | Full table | Pruned set  |
